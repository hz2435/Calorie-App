# Image Recognition Calorie Tracker App

An app that allows users to take a picture of food/meals. The app has an image recognition function to identify the meal and provide a total sum of the calories in the photo. This way, the app can provide an accessible and convenient way for users to determine how many calories they are consuming without having to google ingredients and tally numbers up themselves. 

Used a third party chart library downloaded from PhilJay on Github and added it to my project in order to display bar charts.
Image recognition function was implemented through Tensorflow model. I obtained the trained Tensorflow image model from NutriSnap on Github, and I modified their implementation class to use the downloaded model.
